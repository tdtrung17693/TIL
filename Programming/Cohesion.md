# Cohesion

Better -> Worst

* Functional Cohesion:

* Sequential Cohesion
* Communicational Cohesion
* Procedural Cohesion
* Temporal Cohesion
* Logical Cohesion
    - Functionaliy combined for task, regardlessof intent.
    - Functions do not make sense in their context
* Coincidental Cohesion
    - Functionality arbitrarily grouped
    - Lack of any cohesion at all
